# Hook interfaces

This library provides a number of convenient interfaces for hooking GoldenLayout [Container events](https://www.golden-layout.com/docs/Container.html#Events). Each interface has a single hook method whose name corresponds to one of the events emitted by a GoldenLayout [Container](https://www.golden-layout.com/docs/Container.html). Your component be automatically configured to recevied notification for each callback interface implemented; **there is no need to manually register callback handlers**.
